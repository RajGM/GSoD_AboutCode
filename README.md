## Time Commitments 

* The above timeline is tentative and is for providing a rough idea of the planned project work. Full efforts will be made to stick to it. A much more detailed schedule will be shared with the mentors during the community bonding period after finalizing the exact approach for the project. 
* The expected time commitment for GSoD this time is 20 hours/week. I have no prior commitments during the coding period so will easily be able to contribute for the necessary time (even more if need be). 
* My college summer break starts on March 15 and classes resume on May 15 (tentative).

# **General Notes**

I firmly believe that communication is one of the most important aspects of open source programs like GSoD. To make sure that the project status is communicated properly, I will be undertaking the following steps:

* Participating in standups and community meetings.
* Publishing a bi-weekly blog post detailing the work done, problems faced, and how they were resolved.
* Maintaining a google doc with daily updates. Even if I’m stuck on some issue I will be writing that down in the doc. I believe this is a very effective way of not only maintaining accountability but also ensuring smooth asynchronous communication.
* Contacting the mentors daily to keep them in the loop of the progress of the project.
* I will be available to communicate via Slack, Discord, and any other communication medium available via Internet (Video Conference, Audio Conference, etc).

## Past open source experience

I would like to share that I am a part of the Hyperledger organization.

Links: 

[orgs/LFX/Hyperledger/chia-connector](https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/fd61c1c4-1245-4f46-a942-d837333bcaaf)

[DraftPR for Cactus](https://github.com/RajGM/cactus/commit/04748bf54471a953602a3d365fbafc3fbdd91b51)

Over the semester, I improved myself with strategies on how to do multiple things at a time. As a result, I aced my capabilities. Working with various communities is what I'm most proud of. It taught me the importance of building a network and networking with folks.

This opportunity would also let me dive deeper into following good practices to write code and taking suggestions from communities via issues and incorporating them. Hence, I am applying with full enthusiasm for the same.

<br />

# **Post GSoD Plans**

I’m **not** applying for GSoD under any other organization this year since I am looking to learn in depth about PurlDB and use it in my side project.

Post the GSoD period I would love to continue contributing by improving the documentation not only to the opened issues but by creating new one as required.

Once the project is completed, I’ll try to provide mentorship, improve on boarding experience and bug fixes for it since I want to contribute to the project in some or another way. Apart from that, I’ll always be a part of the AboutCode community and will be following as well as contributing towards its development and documentation.

# _Special note for the reviewers_: 

I am flexible enough if the mentor/maintainer/organizer thinks to change anything from above as per the requirements. I have just divided the work into 90 days to make clear how to work efficiently these days. This process will surely lead to working closely with the mentors.

Additionally, I would like to add that as I am a total newbie, I am still having many doubts about implementation but I am sure enough that with the help of mentors, I will be able to perform the task assigned. Just to let you know, support while coding is highly appreciated!

I am an open-source enthusiast and would highly like to contribute further to the project/work assigned to me after the primary task has been implemented.

I would also additionally love to explore the core inner workings of the project and try to contribute to the same after the primary task has been implemented.
